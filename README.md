# Computer Graphics Library
- They can read in a specific kind of file that contains the coordinate of all vertices on an object, and have it colored, shaded, rendered and finally displayed on the screen.
- For the one in C++, the openGL library was included to realize coloring and illuminating, as well as creating the window to display the object. And some libraries for mathematical use were also applied for matrix calculation needed in rendering algorithm.
- For the one in JavaScript, no libraries were applied. Every function needed including vector calculation, matrix calculation, and many others related to polygon visibility, coloring, shading, illumination was all implemented by myself.
